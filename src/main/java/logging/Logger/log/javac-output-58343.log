[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343] warning: [options] bootstrap class path is not set in conjunction with -source 8
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]   not setting the bootstrap class path may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 8
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]     --release 8 is recommended instead of -source 8 -target 1.8 because it sets the bootstrap class path automatically
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343] warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343] warning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343] warning: [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343] Note: Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were found
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]   on the class path. A future release of javac may disable annotation processing
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]   unless at least one processor is specified by name (-processor), or a search
[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]   path is specified (--processor-path, --processor-module-path), or annotation

[2024-06-05 00:40:46] [javac-output-58343]   Use -Xlint:-options to suppress this message.
